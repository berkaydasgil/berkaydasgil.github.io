      <description>Plans Some plans for the blog are:
  Data visualizations. Would mostly be related to AI applications. I have a fleeting interest in other topics. As I am mostly working on AI those kinds of posts are more likely.
  Deep learning related posts on image and natural language. Performance scaling, benchmarking, creating services are my area of expertise. Systems topics are also in the ballpark.
  My experience with JAM stack and running this static Hugo blog.</description>
